# Venk Bot

Hello! I'm Venk Bot, a multi-purpose Discord bot written in JavaScript created by [VenkSociety](http://github.com/VenkSociety). I'm equipped with lots of features and commands as well as custom configuration to suit your personal preferences.

## Configuration

Configuration is as easy as editing a single file. No coding knowledge needed!

    {
    "prefix": "/", 
    "token": "YOUR-BOT-TOKEN"
    "welcome_msg": "general"
    }
    
In order for the bot to work, you'll need to gather your bot's token and replace "YOUR-BOT-TOKEN" with your bot's token.

To change the prefix for commands, simply replace "/" with whatever your preferred prefix is. E.g. ;help would result in ";".

By default, the channel where the bot will post welcome messages is "general". Simply replace "general" with the channel you'd like the messages to be sent to.
